# Rough idea for site layout

index.html - home page, with news items below the break
- intro.html - introduction
- documentation.html - index page for documentation items:
  - theory.html - overview of the theory behind 2D lineshape analysis
  - tutorials.html
    - downloading and installing NMR TITAN
    - acquiring and processing data
    - analysis walkthrough (FBP examples)
  - casestudies.html - illustrated examples of 2D lineshape analysis in action (shout outs to external users)
  - faqs.html - FAQs, common analysis problems
- citing.html - list of references
- download.html
  - clear instructions how to (1) register, then (2) download
  - also accessible on NMRBox
  - industry
  - contact.html
Footer:
- link to contact.html
- link to main group website

# Notes for development
- work in new-website branch, until ready to go live
- it'd be good to include the google map showing user locations - not sure where!
- the current website is minimal, so we just need something a little better before going live, then can keep building on it
- icons are available at fontawesome.com, using the solid style, e.g. https://fontawesome.com/v6/icons?q=picture&o=r&m=free&s=solid
- the header and footer should be copied to all other pages in the site - take documentation.html as an example, the index.html case is slightly special
- info-elements.html shows lots of examples of how to use the template - or look at some pages from the group website, marked as old-...

# other things to consider
- improving/updating registration form (google form)
- user list is currently a google docs sheet populated by the registration form
- it would be good to set up a mailing list to contact users about updates etc.

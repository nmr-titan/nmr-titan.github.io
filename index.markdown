Since the 1960s, 1D lineshape fitting has been a key method for the quantitative analysis of titration data. Today however, even applications of 1D lineshape analysis have become limited due to the spectral complexity associated with increasingly large biomolecules.

We have therefore developed TITAN, an easy-to-use software package for the 2D lineshape analysis of NMR titration data:
* Rigorous analysis of chemical exchange in 2D experiments
* Resolve overlapping peaks
* Eliminate systematic errors
* Fit data to a variety of binding models
* Import data from nmrPipe
* Create overlays of fitted spectra with a single click
* Use bootstrap methods to calculate error estimates
